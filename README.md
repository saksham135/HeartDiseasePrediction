# About:
Predicting Heart Disease using machine learning
This Notebooks looks into using various python based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

we're going to take following approach :
1. Problem Definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation
